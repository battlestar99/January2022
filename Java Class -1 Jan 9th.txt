Computer Programming: 
Java, Python, C 

Java - object oriented programming language 

Problem - solution 

creating banking account: 

1. distance from your home - 5 miles
2. reputation of the bank - 3.5/5 
3. interest rate - 2 pecent
4. customer service - yes/no
5. mobile app - yes/no
6. charges - 50 dollar 

Core of any programming language 

1. how we can store data in computer and use them, what type of data 

100
Michael 
100.23

datatype>> number, name, ssn, email, decimal 

200 

whole number - int 
decimal number - double, float 
set of character - String, char
conditonal data - boolean 

int, String, boolean, double 

datatype variable = value ;

int x = 200; 

x is integer type of variable which has value 200 

String name = "michael" ;

variable is just a placeholder for a memory location in your computer

int y = 45;

datatype >> specific datatype defined by java to specify which 
type of data you want to store
variable >> is a placeholder or memory space 
value >> whatever stored in the variable 

datatype variable = value; 

int abc = 12; 
double z = 12.0; 
String name = "djfdlf"; 

declaring a varible 

int x ; 












2. how we can create conditional statement - 

3. how we can do iteration - executing same code as many times as we want 

4. data structure - 

5. methods / functions 

6. Object oriented Programming - OOP 


Key Point 1: for naming never use a space 

creating a java project: 
file >> new >> java project 


Java Learning 1: 

class - basic unit of java code 

to write any java code - need to create a class first 

100 word files - resumes, tax docs, car docs, bank docs 

java class - .java file 

one.java
two.java
testscript.java

machine language file - 

one.class
two.class


resume.docx
data.xls
presentation.ppt

key point 2 : {} is used to descripe of scope of class, control statements or 
methods


Java Learning 2: 

To run any class in java you need to add the main method - main method 
is the starting point of any java code - code starts executing from main method 

Two types of class in java 

runnable class - class with a main method - that can be run as java application 

non-runnable class - class without a main method - that can not be run anyhow

.extenstion

folder is place you name to store some files - 

key point 2 : java is a case sensitive lanaguage 

a and A is not same in java
add, subtract, multipe, count

int , double , float 

47834383

String ssn = "343423";

datatype variablename = value; 
int 	x    = 76;
String 	name = "dfkldjf"
double      y = 78.87;
boolean 	flag = true ; 

declaretion + initialzation

Problem: you are working in a car dealership. 
to calculate - car monthly payment 

baseprice
adminfee
tax 
warrently plan 
downpayment
apr - credit score - 
how many months for payment 
monthly payment

scenario 1: your apr should depends on your credit score 
apr =2 
700 > 2 
750 > 1.5
600 > 4 

scenario 2
warrently = 1500
warrenty = 0
