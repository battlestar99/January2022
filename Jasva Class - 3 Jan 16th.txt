Review: 

java project >> src >> package >> class ( .java) 

class >> main method - running the code 

storing data : int, String, double, boolean 

conditional statements: results in a conditional statment 

if(condition) {

// code executes based on condition true or false 

}

else {}
take 3 numbers and find the largest among them 

solution: 

take input 3 numbers 
3 variables - x , y , z 

if(x>y and x>z) >> x is the largest number
else if(y>x and y>z) >> y is the largest number 
else if(z>x and z>y) >> z is the largest number 
else {}

problem solving skill 

learnt: 

1. java setup and project, package, class setup 
2. storing data: 
datatype variablename = value; 
int num = 23; 
String address = "dfjhdf";
double num12 = 65.90; 
boolean flag = true/false; 

Functions/Methods 

looping - for / while - the code will be in the block as long as the condition is true 

if(condition)
for(intialize a variable;condition; increament operation){



}



data structure - array 

x++ >> post increaement

++ x >> pre increaement 

x-- >> post decreament

--x >> pre decreament 

Problem: find out the fibonacci numbers which are less than 2000 








while(database connection is true) {

   // connect to database
 // read a data from database 




}

problem 1: 
Write a program to calculate the sum of first 10 natural number.

1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10....+1000

logical flow: 

 x= 1,2,3,4









x++ 
x-- 

x+=10
x-=3

data structure: how to store big amount of data in our computer program

100 address
100 first name

int x = 34; 

x=45; 

array - 

int x; 
int x [ ] = new int [10]; lenght of the arrary is 10 

String name [] = new String [20]; lenght of the array is 20

double y [ ] = new double [45]; lenthg of this array is 45 

int numbers [  ] = new int [ 1000] ;








two types of error: 

1. syntax error - compiler error 


compile the code and convert to a class file >> .class 

2. run time error - exception 

int x = 0; 
int y = 45; 

int a = y/x; 

problem: 

String arrary = firstname
string array = lastname 

problem: lets create two arrary with firstname and lastname - 
then print 

firstname lastname 

michael - 0 
johnson - 0 

String concatanation 

x+=3
