API or web service testing >> 

Web UI - user interface - functionality testing 

UI - front end - user action 
backend - data storage , data transportation 

interaction with database : 

CRUD - create read update delete 

API - application programming interface - programming library

web service - 

create read update delete 

request 

respone 

1. your company has an application - that has an api 

2. your company is using different companies data - you need to test
the other companies 

functional web UI - manual - automation - java - selenium-cucumber-testng

cypress, katalon

back-end - 

web service - transporation medium - postman, soap ui, ready api
java, rest-assured, http - client, cucumber, testng 

database - sql - workbench - java, jdbc, testng, cucumber


CRUD - 
create
read 
update
delete 

API - web service 

Rest API - 90 percent 

SOAP API - 


where you are going to get the request from? 

How to configure them? 

what is your expected response? 



1. configure the request however required - you need to know what 
request you are going to send and what this request is supposed to 
do 

2. sending a specific request to check if you can 
create read update or delete data 

3. getting a response from the API either in JSON or XML format 

4. validating the response - manually - script 
actual and expected 

5. logging the defects 




Get - reading data from the database - 

post - creating new data - 

Request structure: 

Get â€“ http://agile1tech.com/employees 
configure: authentication method
body of the request: 
test script - associate with the request

API documenation for the api you are going to test - 

swagger 

Doc 1: 

request description: 
getting the list of all the employees 
http Request: 
get 
request URL: 
http://agile1tech.com/employees
authentication: 
bearer token 
response body: 
list of all employees in the company
response code: 
200

steps of starting to test: 

1. API documentation - swagger - talk with developer 

2. API test cases - excel file 

3.creating the test cases in postman - 
bearer token is given by developerr 
I write the test using javascript code of postman 

4. collection - smoke testing
regression testing 
payment module testing collection

5. collection 


things to validate: 

http response code - 
http body - json, xml - transportation 
response time - 5ms, 2ms - performance of the API 

to validate anything what you need: 

expected result - api documentation, developer 
actual result - you are getting from the test


Get - readind data - 200, 404, 400

post - creating new data - 201 ( created)

put - updating data - 200 (ok). 201 (created) 

delete - deleting data - 202 ( accepted) 

500 - internal server error 

 https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2

https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2


https://reqres.in >> URL - uniform resource locator 

https://reqres.in/api/users?>> URI - uniform resourc identifier 

page=2 >> end point 

postman, soap ui , ready api 

postman - web version 

pm.test("Status code is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
pm.test("Body matches string", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.text()).to.include("michael.lawson@reqres.in");

pm.test("Response time is less than 15ms", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(15);
});
});
