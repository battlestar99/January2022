Test Script : automated test case 
code/class/script >> actually execute tests 

Test case: manual test case 
  
java main method >> way of running any java code >> runnable class
non-runnable class >> functions + properties 

loginpage >> 

loginpage lp = new loginpage(); 
Testing Library - TestNG , Cucumber 

1. Test organization - annotations 

100 tests 

2. pass/fail scenario - assertion 
compare expected and actual test 
expected result >> requirements/user stories 
actual result >> after executing the test 

100 tests 

3. Test suite >> collection of test case

100 tests running all together 

4. generate report - 

5. data driven testing - 

selenium - browser automation 



Annotations: annotations are already created in TestNG and following
a set sequeence, with any annotations, we need to add a function
and the code we are going to write inside the function will be executed
when the annotation will execute 


@BeforeTest >> pre-requirment of all  the tests of a test script
@Test >> this is a test
@AfterTest >> post-requirment of the test of all the tests of a test script

BeforeMethod >> get executed before each test , if you have some steps
or code you want to execute before each test 
AfterMethod >> get execute after each test , if you have steps you want to execute after each test 

what is one test? 

one test case 

30 test scripts >> @Test 100 times >> 100 tests, you automated 100 test cases 

an user story >> to validate this user story 
depends on the user story >> 

user story: 101 
A login panel is created in saucedemo, login panel should have
option to take userrname and password, and a loginbutton. user should
be able to login with right username and password. locked out user should not be able to login, and performance issue user should take
extra time login.  After login clicking the back button should log out the user from the system

Test case 01 : validating if the weblements are displayed - username, password, login button is in the login page 

Test case 02: validate if the username and password text boxes are enabled and user is able to type their username and password 
Test case 03: user can login with right username and password 
Test case 04: user can not login with wrong user name and password 
Test case 05: locked out user can not login
Test case 06: performance user can login with delayed response 
Test case 07: vcalidating if clicking back button can log out user from the system 

user story 2: clicking the help link user should be navigate to help page 

Test case 01: click the help and check if user is in the help page

web application testing - selenium - browser automation 
database testing - jdbc 
api testing - rest-assured 

Testing library - specific 
test steps, exepect actual result, environment, test case id 

TestNG or cucumber 

testing template - common structure given to us 

1. testing code - test steps, pre-req, post req - organizing code
2. pass/fail scenerio - assertion 
3. generate a report - 
4. test suite - collection of test case
5. data driven testing - test data

Object driven framework - seperate web elements from test scripts
page object model -  

data driven framework - seperate test data from test scripts 


Steps of creating manual or automation test cases: 

1. requirment - user stories - BRD, SRS 

2. test scenario - test case ( manual / automation) 
jira 
java-selenium-testng/ cypress/protractor
100 test cases - 300 test cases - 5 mins / 2 weeks - 2 erxtra tester
regression >> 
save time and cost 

100 test cases - automated, manual test case 

3 new user stories - 

user story - 1245 

test scneario - 5 test scenario 

5 test cases - in jira - depolyed to test envionrmnet 

5 automated test - 100 + 5 >> 105 automated tests >> regression testing 

user story - 1246 

3 test scenarkio - 3 test cases 

105 + 3 >> 108 automated tests >> regresion test 

enhancement , modification - regresstion testing 

test environment - dev , test1, test2-regression, staging environemnt - UAT - production

backlog 1 - creating 5 test cases - 3 days - 3 story points
back 2 - setting up automation testing - 2 days - 2 story point

10 days - 8-9 days 

1 working scneario - 

Requirment - user story 
Test plan, Test case - develop, creating, executing, automation test script
Defect - track, resolve, close 
Agile-scrum - methodology 
sprint - release 
client-team communication


3. 


As a tester your main responsibility is validate the requirement 




Testing automation: TestNG 

package - Testscript - java-selenium-testng
package - page object model - non runnable class - storing web element
package - utility classes - functions that we can use 
set of test suites - XML files - test suite, data driven

Functions - 

Test suite - collection of test cases or test scripts 
Data driven framework - 

XML - extensible markup language 

tags - staring tag and ending tag 

Data driven framework - seperating test data from test scripts 

xml, excel, database, feature
