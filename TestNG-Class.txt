Test Script : automated test case 
code/class/script >> actually execute tests 

Test case: manual test case 

java main method >> way of running any java code >> runnable class
non-runnable class >> functions + properties 

loginpage >> 

loginpage lp = new loginpage(); 
Testing Library - TestNG , Cucumber 

1. Test organization - annotations 

100 tests 

2. pass/fail scenario - assertion 
compare expected and actual test 
expected result >> requirements/user stories 
actual result >> after executing the test 

100 tests 

3. Test suite >> collection of test case

100 tests running all together 

4. generate report - 

5. data driven testing - 

selenium - browser automation 



Annotations: annotations are already created in TestNG and following
a set sequeence, with any annotations, we need to add a function
and the code we are going to write inside the function will be executed
when the annotation will execute 


@BeforeTest >> pre-requirment of all  the tests of a test script
@Test >> this is a test
@AfterTest >> post-requirment of the test of all the tests of a test script

BeforeMethod >> get executed before each test , if you have some steps
or code you want to execute before each test 
AfterMethod >> get execute after each test , if you have steps you want to execute after each test 

what is one test? 

one test case 

30 test scripts >> @Test 100 times >> 100 tests, you automated 100 test cases 

an user story >> to validate this user story 
depends on the user story >> 

user story: 101 
A login panel is created in saucedemo, login panel should have
option to take userrname and password, and a loginbutton. user should
be able to login with right username and password. locked out user should not be able to login, and performance issue user should take
extra time login.  After login clicking the back button should log out the user from the system

Test case 01 : validating if the weblements are displayed - username, password, login button is in the login page 

Test case 02: validate if the username and password text boxes are enabled and user is able to type their username and password 
Test case 03: user can login with right username and password 
Test case 04: user can not login with wrong user name and password 
Test case 05: locked out user can not login
Test case 06: performance user can login with delayed response 
Test case 07: vcalidating if clicking back button can log out user from the system 

user story 2: clicking the help link user should be navigate to help page 

Test case 01: click the help and check if user is in the help page
