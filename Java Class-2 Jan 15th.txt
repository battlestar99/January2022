Review of Last week: 
how to store data in a variable 

datatype variable = value; 
fundemental or primary datatype of java - 

int a = 34; 

a is an integer type of variable with value 34 

double x = 12.56; 

String name = "john";

boolean flag = false; 

declaretion: 

int x; 

initialization 

x = 55; 

class - 

public class classname{

public static void main(String args[]){

// all code has to go inside the class

// local variables 

}



}



main method: starting point of code 

public static void main(String args[]){



}

local variable: any variables that we create inside the main method 










setting up java environment: 

1. jdk - compiler - that will compile the code you write 
2. eclipse - programming editor - where you write your code

double a = 20; 

20.0

= sign means assining value - assignment 

 == means comparing two values 

conditional statement: 

statements that execute based on if any condition is true 

if(condition){

// code will execute

}












if(condition1) {

100 lines of code here

}






creditscore == 750 

creditscore == 700 

creditscore == 600











if(condition){

}

if(condition1){


}

else{


}


chain of condition 

if(condition1){
}

else if(condition2){

}

else if ( condition3){

}

else if(condition4){

}

else{


}


if/else/else if 

switch - case 

The relationship between conditional statments and boolean variables 

grading calculator: 

>90 - A 
<90 - B 
<80 - C 
< 70 - D

else if - 

A - greater or equal to 90 

B - less than 90 and greatern/equal than 80

C - less than 80 and greater/equal than 70 

D - less than 70 and greater/equal than 60 

F - less than 60 


score<90   score>=80

&& >> and - all conditions have to be true
||   or - only one condition needs to be true 

(condition1 and condition2) >> true




// take 3 numbers from console - and print the largest number 

123
654
43


largest number 654
