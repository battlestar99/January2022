Cucumber - Testing Library or framework 

setup : 

1. plugin to install in your eclipse 

2. programming libraries - copy the jar files to the java project and add them to your build path 

cucumber - BDD - behaviour driven devlopment - testing the behaviour 
of the application 

TDD - test driven development - you have to write tests even before the application is developed - analyzing the requirment 

login panel - 

1. user name and password to login
2. user has to be only characters
3. password can not be less than 8 charaters - 

write the test - share it with the developers - 

Testscript - Technical - programming 

cucumber has two component: 

component 1: non technical - 
component 2: technical code - that only automation testers can understand

Testing library: TestNG / Cucumber

1. code organization
2. pass/fail scenario - assertion 
3. Test suite - multiple tests 
4. generate report - 
5. data driven framework - 

non-technical - Feature file - Test Scenarios - Feature files - we 
add test scenarios 
technical - step definition - java - selenium

Test suite - Test runner - Junit

Feature: 
gherkin language - gherkin keywords 

Given - pre condition of the test 
When - the user action 
Then - feedback of the application based on user action 
And - just adding more when and then 
But - user is expecting any reverse or negative behaviour from the application


@Given
public void setup(){

// going to get execute
}

@When

@BeforeTest
public void setupTest(){

}

TDD - you write test before the development begins 
Test driven development - 

manual test cases - 
manual test - 

test name : validateLogin

Reporter.log("this test is about something")

can not implement one step multiple time 

70 test case X 5 = 350 steps 

100 steps - 200 steps 






User story: 

saucedemo 
user should be able to add and remove product from the cart 

Feature: 

step definition:

Cucumber - 

1. chrome browser - 
2. chrome driver - location 
3. local and global variable 

declaration 
initialization 

declare
webDriver driver; 

int x; 

x=12;

driver = new chromedriver(); 


cucumber - two components 

feature file - non technical - gherkin language 
given when then and but 

step defition - technical - java class 

selenium library - two selenium jars 
testng - bring one testng - 3 libraries 
cucumber - cucumber jars - selenium jars 

plugins are for eclipse - 

test suite 
test report 

Test runner >> test suite + test report

junit test runner >> 

data driven testing 

Beforemethod >> @Test

Background happens before each scenario

Hooks >> are used to execute steps before and after all the feature 
file 

@Before
@After

data driven framework using cucumber: 

object driven framework - implemented through page object model
