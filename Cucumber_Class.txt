non-technical - Feature file - Test Scenarios - Feature files - we

But - user is expecting any reverse or negative behaviour from the application


@Given
public void setup(){

// going to get execute

}

TDD - you write test before the development begins 
Test driven development - 

manual test cases - 
manual test - 

test name : validateLogin

Reporter.log("this test is about something")

can not implement one step multiple time 

70 test case X 5 = 350 steps
